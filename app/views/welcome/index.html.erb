  Tecnologia / Rock / Futbol <span class="font-bold">sidebar</span>, <span class="font-bold">main</span>
  content area, and <span class="font-bold">footer</span>.
  This full-height layout is never more than viewport height. The content area scrolls
  independently as needed. For this example, we're using the <a class="text-indigo-600" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>
  utility framework. As part of it's default classes, Tailwind includes Flexbox classes which make this layout
  implementation simple!
</p>
<p class="py-2 text-xl">
  Additionally, this layout is <span class="italic">responsive</span>. As screen width decreases down to 640px (the smallest Tailwind breakpoint), the layout stacks vertically.
  The sidebar orientation is flipped from vertical to horizontal (<code>flex-col sm:flex-row</code>), and the main content area fills the remaining height
  above the footer.
